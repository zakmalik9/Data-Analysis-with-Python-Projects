# Data-Analysis-with-Python-Projects

These are the 5 projects I completed as part of the [Data Analysis with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/) Certification by freeCodeCamp in March 2022.

This certification covers the fundamentals of data analysis with Python. It teaches how to read data from sources like CSVs and SQL, and how to use libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to process and visualize data.

The individual project instructions and explanations can be found in their folders.
